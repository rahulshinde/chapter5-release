					<span class="bold">A NOTE FROM THE PRESS PRESS TEAM:</span>Over the past two years that the Press Press team has been in residence at the Catonsville site of Baltimore City Community College Refugee Youth Project, we have had the pleasure to collaborate with and learn from the many young writers and artists of the program. During our stay, we’ve been able to publish a range of works together and investigate various themes pertaining to our young writers’ lives, many of which have roots in Myanmar. The multi-cultural space we built, which is made up of entirely second-language speakers (all of the Press Press facilitators present are also second-language English speakers), attempts to combat traditional classroom power dynamics by creating a situation where each member of the group is both a facilitator and a learner. As group members, we are supportive of each individual’s way of expression, rather than assimilating into accepted American-English speaking models. We believe that the artwork we produce exists within the time and experiences we have together, rather than singularly existing in our published written works.
					<br>
					<br>
					In our on-going conversations, similar themes reemerge, such as our hopes for the places that we come from, or rather, the places that we left in order to find more fruitful lives in Baltimore, as well as our hopes for Baltimore, for our families and friends. In reaction to these on-going conversations, we attempted to thoroughly investigate what our ideal, collective world would look like in a three-month intensive writing retreat that took inspiration from the prompt If I Ruled The World. In an interview with Dan Paz (Shifter Magazine, Issue Nr. 20) Tania Bruguera notes, “Education is the moment when you know yourself as a social being, of the inescapable situation of your role to come as part of society.” Inspired by this mode of thinking, and while witnessing a historic moment in Burma’s evolution into, what we hope will be, a truly democratic nation, our conversations were constantly shifting between real-time happenings, our futuristic aspirations and our roles as active beings in the world we envision.
					<br>
					<br>
					The following pages include a timeline of the conversations we had as events in Burma unfolded and selection of writings that group members produced. We hope you are able to share in some of our experiences together through this collection of works.
